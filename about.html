    <h2>About Grimoire App</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Grimoire is a simple, single page app that generates random treasure loot for the Pathfinder Role Playing Game system.</li>
    <li>It utilizes roll tables and loot tables from the Core Rulebook and the Advanced Player's Guide.</li>
    <li>Spell lists are taken from the CRB, APG, and additionally Ultimate Magic and several other sources</li>
    <li>Some randomly determined properties (such as the create type of a Bane weapon) do not have official roll tables. I made up my own roll tables for these values.</li>
    <li>GMs are highly encouraged to add/remove/disregard any item or part of an item that they want to the random loot drops.</li>
    </ul>
